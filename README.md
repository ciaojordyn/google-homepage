Thank you for taking the time to read my code! 

This is my first attempt at building a site in more than a decade -- my last projects were Neopets pet pages from my childhood. Ideally, as I continue my studies, I will return to this project and add more complex elements via Javascript to create a site more faithful to the current code.
